	\section neiblist_overview General overview
	\note For sake of simplicity all explanations and figures refers to a 2D simualtion. The extension to 3D
	is trivial.
	
	<p>Only the particles lying inside the SPH kernel support (of radius \f$ \kappa h \f$) participate to
	the SPH sums. One step of the SPH computation is then to find the neighbors within a given radius of
	an arbitrary set of particles. For \f$ n \f$ particles the complexity of the naive algorithm (in which
	we evaluate the distance between al particle) is \f$ \mathcal{O}(n) \f$. With simulations involving 
	millions of particle we need to use a more effeceint algorithm. The calssical approach is to create 
	a geometrical partition and for each particles search for neigbhors in a fixed size susbset. This
	will involve the creation of a tree or a sorting operation. In that case he complexity of the tree creation 
	or the sort is generally \f$ \mathcal{O}(n\log n) \f$ and the complexity of the neighbor search 
	\f$ \mathcal{O}(n) \f$. The overall complexity is then \f$ \mathcal{O}(n\log n) \f$.</p>
	<p>In GPUSPH we decide to use an underlying grid structure : we subdivide the
	simulation domain in a grid of cell of size \f$ \kappa h \f$ and then search for neighbors in the
	cell containing \f$P\f$ and it's immediate surrounding (see figure 1).</p>
	\image html sort_grid0.pdf "Figure 1: potential neighbors of P" width=18cm
	<p>For the compuation of SPH sums we have then two options:
	<ol>
		<li> get the neighbors as described above </li>
		<li> use a list containing the indices of the neighbors of all the particles </li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	
	<p>The first option is easy to implement but requires for each sum (or each group of sum that can be computed
	in the same loop) a walk through 9 in 2D (or 27 in 3D) cells containing potential neighbors.</p>
	<p>The second option will still require a walk trough the cells containing potential neighbors,
	but will result in a list of neighbor for all particles (real neighbors not potential ones ..), list that will be 
	used for all the SPH sums involved in a time step. 
	The main drawback of this approach is the large amount of memory used for the storage of the neighbor list.
	Moreover, considering that for explicit integration schemes the CFL condition results in quite small time steps 
	we can generate the neighbor list each \f$n_{neib} > 1\f$ iterations and reuse-it.</p>
	
	<p>In GPUSPH we decide to use the second option and generate a neighbor list.</p>
	<p>The construction of the neighbor list is basically a for steps process :
	<ol>
		<li> compute an hash based on the particle position in the grid </li>
		<li> sort according to the hash value </li>
		<li> reorder all particle data according to the sort </li>
		<li> construct the list of neighbor indices </li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	
	<p> As usual the host side of the code is encapsulated in the CUDANeibsEngine class and the
	device code in cuneibs namespace.</p>
	
	\section neiblist_detail Detailed description
	\subsection neiblist_grid Grid and cell size
	<p>Let's consider a simulation domain of size <tt>(size.x, size.y)</tt>. The size of the grid is then 
	computed as follow :
	<ul style="list-style: none;">
		<li> <tt>gridsize.x = floor(size.x / cellSide)</tt> </li>
		<li> <tt>gridsize.y = floor(size.y / cellSide)</tt> </li>
	</ul>
	with <tt>cellSide</tt> equals to \f$ \kappa h \f$ or \f$ \kappa h + \frac{\Delta p}{2}\f$ when using SA boundary.
	The size of the cells is then readjusted :
	<ul style="list-style: none;">
		<li> <tt>cellsize.x = size.x / gridsize.x</tt> </li>
		<li> <tt>cellsize.y = size.y / gridsize.x</tt> </li>
	</ul>
	In this way we are sure that <tt>cellsize</tt> is at least \f$ \kappa h \f$ (or \f$ \kappa h + \frac{\Delta p}{2}\f$).</p>
	
	<p>With SA boundary the criterion used to include boundary element particles in the neighbor list of a particle \f$ P \f$ should 
	rely on the geometrical distance between the particle and the boundary element: all the boundary element particles are neighbors of 
	\f$ P \f$ if \f$ d \leq \kappa h \f$ (figure 2.a).
	\image html sort_grid_SA_a.pdf "Figure 2.a" width=8cm
	Instead of that we use the distance between the particle and the boundary element particles: a particle \f$ i \f$ of the boundary element 
	is a neighbor of \f$ P \f$ if \f$ d_i \leq \kappa h + \frac{\Delta p}{2}\f$ (figure 2.b).
 	\image html sort_grid_SA_b.pdf "Figure 2.b" width=8cm
 	The main advantage of this approach is to use the sorting grid to search for neighboring boundary element particles. This come at
 	the cost of two main drawbacks: the size of the boundary elements must be inferior to \f$ \Delta p \f$ and the increased cell size will
 	result in useless distance compuation when no boundary elements are involved.</p>
 	\warning The size of boundary elements with SA boundary should be inferior to \f$ \Delta p \f$
 	
 	\subsection neiblist_hash Hash computation
 	<p>We associate to a cell it's integer coordinates in the grid <tt>gridPos</tt> (in <tt>{0, ..., gridSize.x -1}x{0, ..., gridSize.y -1}</tt>
	and it's linear index <tt>cellHash</tt> (numbering starting in the \f$x\f$ or \f$y\f$ direction, depending on the user choice) (see figure 3).
	\image html sort_grid1.pdf "Figure 3: blue cell coordinate, black cellHash" width=18cm
	Computing <tt>gridPos</tt> from <tt>cellHash</tt> (and the opposite) is easy:
	<ul style="list-style: none;">
		<li> <tt>cellHash = gridPos.y*gridsize.x + gridPos.x</tt> </li>
		<li> <tt>gridPos.y = (int)cellHash / gridSize.x</tt> </li>
		<li> <tt>gridPos.x = cellHash - gridPos.y*gridSize.x</tt> </li>
	</ul>
	
	The grid relative hash value (<tt>gridhash</tt>) of a particle \f$ P \f$ is based on the <tt>cellHash</tt> of the cell in which \f$ P \f$ 
	belong. Actually when using multiple devices (GPUs) the <tt>gridhash</tt> is the <tt>cellHash</tt> plus the device number, otherwise it's
	equal to the <tt>cellHash</tt>. When particles are generated on the CPU with position in double precision the <tt>gridhash</tt> is computed 
	once from the particle position \f$ (x, y) \f$ as:
	<ul style="list-style: none;">
		<li> <tt>gridPos.x = (int)floor((x - origin.x) / cellsize.x)</tt> </li>
		<li> <tt>gridPos.y = (int)floor((y - origin.y) / cellsize.y)</tt> </li>
		<li> <tt>gridhash = gridPos.y*gridsize.x + gridPos.x</tt> </li>
	</ul>
	where <tt>origin</tt> is the origin of the simulation global reference frame.</p>

	<p>It's important to remenber that, except for the particle generation step, we never have the absolute particle position but rather
	it's relative position respect to the particle cell center. In order to not loose accuracy we cannot compute absolute position in single
	precison, so rather then computing a new <tt>gridhash</tt> we evolve it according to the particle motion.</p>
	
	<p>Suppose that a particle \f$ i \f$ moved from \f$ (x_{old}, y_{old}) \f$ to \f$ (x, y) \f$ since the last neighbor list construction. 
	In the first phase of the current neighbor list construction (i.e. before completion of hash computation) the particle 
	positions and hash are still relative to the cell containing the particle when we construct the current neighbor list (see figure 4). 
	\image html hash_evolve.pdf "Figure 4: hash computation" width=18cm	
	The hash of particle \f$ i \f$ is evolved in the following way:
	<ul>
		<li> compute the <tt>gridPos</tt> position of particle \f$ i \f$ form it's <tt>gridHash</tt> </li>
		<li> compute the change in grid coordinates, <tt>gridOffset</tt>, from postion \f$ (x_{old}, y_{old}) \f$ to \f$ (x, y) \f$ </li>
		<li> compute grid hash according to <tt>gridPos</tt> and <tt>gridOffset</tt>. Without periodicity we have: <br>
			<tt>gridHash = (gridPos.y + gridOffset.y)*gridSize.x + griPos.x + gridOffset.x</tt> </li>
		<li> adjust particle coordinates respect to the cell containing the particle:<br>
			<tt>x = x - gridOffset.x*cellSize.x</tt><br>
			<tt>y = y - gridOffset.y*cellSize.y</tt> </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	\todo Fix variable naming: use gridPos and gridHash or cellPos and cellHash but not both !
	
	\subsection neiblist_sort Sort
	<p>When particles are created an absolute identifier, <tt>id</tt>, is assigned to each particle. This <tt>id</tt> will never be altered
	and allow us to follow a particle during the simulation. The particle <tt>id</tt> is stored, among other informations, in the 
	<tt>particleInfo</tt> array. Beside that all particle data are accessed trough their <tt>index</tt> in the arrays. 
	Then the <tt>index</tt> of a particle change each time we reoder the particle data after the sort. Obviously at the beginning of the
	simulation and before the first neighbor list creation particle <tt>id</tt> equals particle <tt>index</tt>.</p>
	<p>The sort is done with thrust and it's a in place (i.e. data and key arrays are directly sorted) sort by key. For the choice of the key 
	we need to take into account that:
	<ol>
		<li>multi-GPU simulation requires data duplication and exchange between GPU: the sort must always give the same result</li>
		<li>we want to be able to do particle type wise neighbor list traversal: i.e compute only fluid-fluid, 
		fluid-boundary, ... interactions</li>
	</ol>
	The solution is to do a multiple key sort based on the particle hash, type and id. At the end of the sort the particle indexes, hash
	and info arrays (<tt>particleIndex</tt>, <tt>particleHash</tt>, <tt>particleInfo</tt>) are ordered according to the key. 
	The whole procedure is illustreted below.</p>
	<p>We start with the current particle dsitribution (see figure 5). The situation depicted in figure 5 corresponds to the very beginning
	of the simulation where particle <tt>id</tt> equals particle <tt>index</tt>.
