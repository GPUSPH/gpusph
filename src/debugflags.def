/*! \file
 * \brief Debug flags definition.
 *
 * Individual debug flags are defined here. This file is included as-is
 * from src/debugflags.h, and is processed to generate two files:
 * src/parse-debugflags.h
 * 	which is included by src/debugflags.cc to parse the flag names
 * src/describe-debugflags.h
 * 	which is included by src/main.cc to provide help on the debug flags
 */

/* Please follow the convention:
 * Each debug flag is preceded by a 'header' comment that describes the flag in
 * a short one-liner. This header comment is marked by a triple / at the beginning
 * of the line.
 * The header is followed by an optional comment providing longer comments
 * (e.g. for Doxygen), and finally by the flag definition itself.
