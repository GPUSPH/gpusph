 Contributing to GPUSPH
========================

Introduction
============

Until version 4, the only publicly available development branches of GPUSPH
have been ``master`` (holding the current released version, with a most a couple of
trivial bug fixes) and ``candidate`` (holding the feature-complete, in-testing
release candidate for the upcoming version). The main development branch, ``next``,
was only accessible to partners directly involved with GPUSPH.

Between version 4 and version 5, the ``next`` development branch has been made
public as well, to improve opportunities for collaboration without the
difficulties of basing one's work on a obsolescent code base.

Methodology
===========

The GPUSPH development history is tracked with git_. Before you get started,
you may want to get familiar with the ``git`` tool itself; an excellent resource
in this regard is the freely available `Pro Git`_ book.

.. _git: https://git-scm.com
.. _Pro Git: https://git-scm.com/book/

GPUSPH follows a centralized development model with feature branches. There is
`a main repository (hosted on GitHub) <repo_>`_,
with reference branches (``master``, ``candidate``, ``next``).

.. _repo: https://github.com/GPUSPH/gpusph

The ``next`` branch is the main development branch. New features
should be developed in independent branches forked off the current ``next``
branch. They will be merged back into the ``next`` branch on completion.

The ``candidate`` branch represent a feature-freeze release-candidate for the
upcoming version of GPUSPH. When the ``next`` branch is considered ready for
release, it will be merged into ``candidate``, which undergoes more thorough
testing and may receive appropriate bug-fixes.

When ready, the ``candidate`` branch is promoted to ``master``, and a new
GPUSPH release is tagged. If further bugfixes are necessary, they are applied
to ``master`` directly, which is then merged back into ``candidate`` and into
``next``.

Communication
=============

The `GitHub issue tracker <tracker_>`_ is available to submit specific issues about building
and running GPUSPH, as well as to present any feature request.

For more general discussion about GPUSPH, its use and development, please join
`the GPUSPH Discourse Forum <forum_>`_.

The GPUSPH developers can also be found on IRC, ``#gpusph`` channel on the
`LiberaChat`_ network (`web interface`_).

Reading the source
====================

If you wish to contribute, it's better to start by getting familiar with
the source code itself, starting from the way it's laid out on disk.


Repository layout
-----------------

The repository top-level is thus structured:

    ``src/``
        Holds the main source directory.
    ``options/``
        Configuration-specific header files are stored here.
    ``scripts/``
        Holds auxiliary scripts to e.g. find the main GPU architecture or
        analyze/compare result files.
    ``docs/``
        Holds the documentation.
    ``data_files/``
        Created by ``scripts/get-data-files``, holds the support data files for
        the sample test cases.
    ``build/``, ``dist/``
        Object files and final executable will be stored here.
    ``tests/``
        By default, test cases will store their data in a subdirectory of this.

The ``src`` directory is thus structured:

    ``geometries/``
        Classes describing geometrical objects (cubes, cones, cylinders, etc).
    ``writers/``
        Classes implementing the ``Writer`` interface, to store simulation results on disk.
    ``cuda/``
        CUDA implementation of the simulation framework and its engines.
    ``problems/``
        Sample test cases
    ``problems/user/``
        User test cases


Main program flow
-----------------

The program entrypoint can be found in ``src/main.cc``, which takes care of
instantiating the ``Problem`` requested by the user at build time, as well as
the simulation engine itself (``GPUSPH``, implemented in ``src/GPUSPH.cc``)
and, if appropriate, the network manager for multi-node support.

The user-specified test-case subclasses ``Problem`` and defines the simulation
framework parameters (SPH formulation, viscous and boundary model, etc) as
well as the domain geometry and filling.

GPUSPH uses a “dumb worker” approach: the main engine ``GPUSPH`` gives
commands to one or more ``GPUWorker``, which each worker running in its own thread
and managing a separate device (GPU). ``GPUSPH`` itself takes care of
all initializations and host allocation, whereas all aspects of device management
are handled by the ``GPUWorker`` instances which, once initialized, enter
their own main loop, waiting for commands from ``GPUSPH`` and mapping these
to appropriate computational kernel invocations. The sequences of commands to
be executed during a simulation are define by ``Integrator`` instances.
Available integrators can be found under ``src/integrators``.

The computational kernel themselves are provided by the simulation framework,
which is a collection of engines taking care of separate parts of the
simulation (boundary conditions, forces computation, integration, etc) and is
instantiated by the ``Problem`` subclass implementing the user-specified
test-case.

Contributing a change
=====================

If you wish to contribute a change to GPUSPH (be it a fix or a new feature),
it's recommended you first discuss it with the core developers
on `the issue tracker <tracker_>`_ or `the forum <forum_>`_.

To contribute, you should fork the main GPUSPH repository on GitHub,
push your changes to your fork, and `create a pull request <pull_>`_
so that we may consider your contribution for inclusion.

.. _pull: https://github.com/GPUSPH/gpusph/pulls

Try to keep your commits self-sufficient (each commit should compile and run),
and independent (please don't commit multiple fixes in a single commit).
Multiple commits to implement a more complex change are perfectly fine
(in fact, even encouraged).
