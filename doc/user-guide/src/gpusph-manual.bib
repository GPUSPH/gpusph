	abstract = {The present paper aims at proposing a fast algorithm permitting to detect the free-surface in particle simulations,
and next to define a level-set function on a cartesian grid. The latter allows for analyzing in detail the free surface shape of three-dimensional simulations as well as internal features of the flow, by using standard visualization tools. The algorithms proposed for detecting the free-surface particles are described in both two and three dimensions, and are validated on simple and complex flow simulations. Then, the derivation of the level-set function is detailed and the usefulness of the proposed method to post-process and analyze complex flows are illustrated on realistic 2D and 3D examples.},

	title = {Turbulent {Flows}},
	url = {http://stacks.iop.org/0957-0233/12/i=11/a=705},
	abstract = {It was a pleasure to read this important book. To understand and predict the development of turbulent flows represents both a continuing scientific challenge and also a serious practical problem in many different fields. Professor Pope has based his book on graduate level lecture courses on turbulence that he has presented at MIT and at Cornell University. It is intended for students in engineering, applied mathematics, oceanography and atmospheric sciences, as well as researchers and practising engineers. The emphasis is on turbulent flows , rather than on the theory of homogeneous turbulence, and only constant-density, nonreacting flows are considered. The author states that his aim is to explain concepts and develop the necessary mathematical tools, rather than to provide a practical guide to turbulence modelling. The text is divided into two parts. Part I provides an introduction to turbulent flows and the fundamental physical processes involved. Topics discussed in separate chapters include: the equations of fluid motion, the statistical description of turbulent flows, the mean flow equations, free shear flows, scales of turbulent motion and wall flows. The chapter on statistical methods for turbulence is particularly good; together with the related appendices it represents a valuable and accessible introduction to the subject. Several approaches for modelling or simulating turbulent flows are then described in Part II , in which the various chapters describe direct numerical simulation (DNS), turbulent viscosity models such as the k -ε model, Reynolds stress and related second-moment models, probability density function (pdf) models and large-eddy simulation (LES) techniques. Finally, some necessary mathematical tools are summarized in ten Appendices dealing with a wide range of relevant topics including tensors, Dirac delta functions, Fourier transforms, random processes, derivation of pdf equations, characteristic functions and stochastic descriptions of diffusion processes. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on modelling and simulation of turbulent flows. A unified treatment of the different types of model has enabled the author to make valuable connections between them and to reach clear and logical conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Over many years Professor Pope has made very important contributions to the development and application of pdf methods for the prediction of nonreactive and also reactive turbulent flows. The chapter on this subject is an exceptionally clear description of these powerful and often under-utilized simulation methods. The final chapter, on LES, provides an excellent introduction, with valuable and novel insights into both the promise and the problems of this relatively new and rapidly developing approach. It should be compulsory reading for many LES practitioners. Each section of the book contains a number of exercises , which typically invite the reader either to derive an expression that is quoted in the text or to generalize an analysis set out in the text. These exercises are often divided into several stages, and contain appropriate instructions, so that a diligent student will find his or her way through them. An advantage of the extensive use of appendices and student exercises is that analytical clarity and physical understanding are not obscured by unnecessary algebraic detail or by the need to review basic mathematical tools. The result is an exceptionally clear presentation, together with an often penetrating critique of both classical methods and recent developments in the theory and modelling of turbulent flows. There is excellent cross-referencing between one section and another, and an extensive and up-to-date bibliography. I strongly recommend this book to advanced students of fluid mechanics, to their teachers and to all researchers, engineers and others with a professional interest in turbulent flows. K N C Bray},

We show that, when these forces are chosen correctly, and the boundary particle spacing is a factor of 2 (or more) less than the fluid particle spacing, the total boundary force on a fluid SPH particle is perpendicular to boundaries with negligible error. Furthermore, the variation in the force as a fluid particle moves, while keeping a fixed distance from the boundary, is also negligible. The method works equally well for convex or concave boundaries. The new boundary forces simplify SPH algorithms and are superior to other methods for simulating complicated boundaries. We apply the new method to (a) the rise of a cylinder contained in a curved basin, (b) the spin down of a fluid in a cylinder, and (c) the oscillation of a cylinder inside a larger fixed cylinder. The results of the simulations are in good agreement with those obtained using other methods, but with the advantage that they are very simple to implement.},

The temporal evolution of the moving front has been measured and evaluated. It was observed that the dilution using a very small amount (a few weight ppm) of a long chain polymer (polyethylene-oxide) in the fluid strongly affected flow properties. Pronounced drag reduction has been found in dry bed flows (whereas the polymer increased the viscosity of the fluid). The presence of a few mm-thick ambient fluid layer in the channel effectively destroyed drag reduction, in spite of the fact that strong turbulence was obvious and the propagation velocity of the front was almost unchanged.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Semi-analytical wall boundary conditions present a mathematically rigorous framework to prescribe the influence of solid walls in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for fluid flows. In this paper they are investigated with respect to the skew-adjoint property which implies exact energy conservation. It will be shown that this property holds only in the limit of the continuous SPH approximation, whereas in the discrete SPH formulation it is only approximately true, leading to numerical noise. This noise, interpreted as a form of “turbulence”, is treated using an additional volume diffusion term in the continuity equation which we show is equivalent to an approximate Riemann solver. Subsequently two extensions to the boundary conditions are presented. The first dealing with a variable driving force when imposing a volume flux in a periodic flow and the second showing a generalization of the wall boundary condition to Robin type and arbitrary-order interpolation. Two modifications for free-surface flows are presented for the volume diffusion term as well as the wall boundary condition. In order to validate the theoretical constructs numerical experiments are performed showing that the present volume flux term yields results with an error 5 orders of magnitude smaller then previous methods while the Robin boundary conditions are imposed correctly with an error depending on the order of the approximation. Furthermore, the proposed modifications for free-surface flows improve the behavior at the intersection of free surface and wall as well as prevent free-surface detachment when using the volume diffusion term. Finally, this paper is concluded by a simulation of a dam break over a wedge demonstrating the improvements proposed in this paper.},

In this paper the formulation will be extended to 3-D, again providing analytical formulae. Due to the boundary being two dimensional a domain decomposition algorithm needs to be employed in order to obtain special integration domains. For these the analytical formulae will be presented when using the Wendland kernel. The algorithm presented within this paper is applied to several academic test-cases for which either analytical results or simulations with other methods are available.
